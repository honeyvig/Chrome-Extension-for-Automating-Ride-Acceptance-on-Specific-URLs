# Chrome-Extension-for-Automating-Ride-Acceptance-on-Specific-URLs
create a Chrome extension that automates the process of accepting rides on a ride management platform. The extension should work seamlessly on specific URLs and automate the following tasks:

Key Features:
Detect when a new ride is available on the page.
Automatically select the correct vehicle based on the ride type.
Click the "Accept Ride" button to confirm the ride.
Work on both live production URLs (e.g., https://control.transfeero.com/new_rides) and local test pages (file:/// URLs).
Include dynamic detection of page changes using tools like MutationObservers.
Requirements:
The extension must work on the following URLs:
https://control.transfeero.com/new_rides
file:///Users/.../test.html (and similar file:// URLs).
The code should be clean, well-documented, and optimized for performance.
Must use manifest_version 3 for Chrome extensions.
Proper validation for vehicle selection to match the requested ride type.
Deliverables:
A working Chrome extension that can be loaded via Developer Mode.
Source files (manifest.json, content.js, and any other necessary scripts).
Instructions for installing and testing the extension.
Basic error handling and debugging support.
Preferred Skills:
Experience developing Chrome extensions.
Proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Familiarity with MutationObservers and event-driven programming.
Knowledge of browser extension security and permissions.
This project is straightforward but requires attention to detail to ensure compatibility and functionality. If you have prior experience developing Chrome extensions or automating web tasks, please include links to your previous work or examples.
------
To develop the Chrome extension that automates the process of accepting rides on a ride management platform, here's the code that can meet the requirements using Manifest v3 and MutationObservers.
Project Structure

    manifest.json - Metadata and permissions required for the extension.
    content.js - The script to interact with the page, detect new rides, select a vehicle, and click the "Accept Ride" button.
    background.js (Optional) - For handling extension-related background processes (if needed).

1. manifest.json (Manifest Version 3)

This is the metadata file for the Chrome extension.

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Auto Accept Ride",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Automates accepting rides on the Transfeero platform.",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage"
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": [
        "https://control.transfeero.com/new_rides",
        "file:///Users/*/test.html"
      ],
      "js": ["content.js"],
      "run_at": "document_idle"
    }
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "http://*/*",
    "https://*/*",
    "file:///*"
  ]
}

2. content.js

The content script will detect when new rides appear, select the appropriate vehicle, and click the "Accept Ride" button. It will use MutationObserver to watch for changes on the page.

// content.js

// Function to check if the "Accept Ride" button is available and click it
function acceptRide() {
  const acceptButton = document.querySelector('.accept-ride-button');
  if (acceptButton) {
    acceptButton.click();
    console.log('Ride accepted!');
  } else {
    console.log('No available ride to accept at the moment.');
  }
}

// Function to dynamically select the vehicle based on ride type
function selectVehicle(rideType) {
  const vehicleSelect = document.querySelector('.vehicle-select');
  if (vehicleSelect) {
    // Example: Select a vehicle based on the ride type
    let selectedVehicle = null;

    if (rideType === 'Luxury') {
      selectedVehicle = vehicleSelect.querySelector('.luxury-vehicle');
    } else if (rideType === 'Economy') {
      selectedVehicle = vehicleSelect.querySelector('.economy-vehicle');
    }

    if (selectedVehicle) {
      selectedVehicle.click();
      console.log(`Vehicle selected: ${rideType}`);
    } else {
      console.log('No matching vehicle found for the ride type.');
    }
  }
}

// Function to observe changes in the DOM for new rides
function monitorNewRides() {
  const rideContainer = document.querySelector('.ride-container');
  if (rideContainer) {
    const observer = new MutationObserver((mutationsList) => {
      mutationsList.forEach((mutation) => {
        if (mutation.type === 'childList') {
          const newRide = mutation.target.querySelector('.new-ride');
          if (newRide) {
            const rideType = newRide.dataset.rideType;  // Example: Getting ride type from data attribute
            selectVehicle(rideType);
            acceptRide();
          }
        }
      });
    });

    observer.observe(rideContainer, {
      childList: true,
      subtree: true
    });
  } else {
    console.log('Ride container not found.');
  }
}

// Initialize the monitoring function
monitorNewRides();

3. background.js (Optional)

This file handles any background tasks. In this case, we may not need a background script, but it can be used to handle specific tasks or state persistence (like storing user preferences, etc.).

// background.js (Optional)
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  console.log('Auto Accept Ride extension installed');
});

Instructions for Installing and Testing the Extension

    Prepare the Extension Files: Create a folder (e.g., auto-accept-ride-extension/) and put the above files (manifest.json, content.js, background.js) in it.

    Load the Extension in Chrome:
        Open Chrome.
        Go to chrome://extensions/.
        Turn on Developer mode.
        Click Load unpacked and select the folder where the extension files are located.
        The extension will now be loaded into Chrome.

    Testing:
        Open a new tab and go to one of the URLs specified in the manifest (either the live URL https://control.transfeero.com/new_rides or a local test file like file:///Users/.../test.html).
        If a new ride is available, the extension will automatically select the appropriate vehicle and click the "Accept Ride" button.
        Ensure that the selectors (.accept-ride-button, .vehicle-select, etc.) are correct based on the actual page structure, as these can vary.

    Debugging:
        Open the Developer Tools (Right-click â†’ Inspect).
        Go to the Console tab to view logs and check if the ride acceptance process works as expected.
        You can also check for any potential errors or issues with the MutationObserver and other DOM interactions.

Notes:

    The MutationObserver monitors for changes in the .ride-container element and triggers the ride acceptance process when a new ride appears.
    The extension assumes that the page uses specific class names (.accept-ride-button, .vehicle-select, .new-ride), but you will need to inspect the HTML structure of the actual page and adjust the selectors accordingly.
    The extension supports both live URLs and local test pages (using file:// URLs).

This code provides a foundational structure for automating the process of accepting rides and can be expanded with additional features like error handling, user preferences, or even a popup for settings.
